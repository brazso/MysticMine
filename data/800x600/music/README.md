Because the music of the original game were bought under a royalty 
free license, and so they cannot be distributed here. However a proper replacement 
for these music files were added to the project with CCBY3/CCBY3/CCBYSA3 
licenses. This includes:

breakneck_loop.ogg -> Corncob
http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100565

heartland.ogg -> Jenny's Theme
http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Jason_Shaw/Audionautix_Acoustic/JENNYS_THEME___________________-45

truck_stop_loop.ogg -> River Valley Breakdown
http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1300032

If you own the original game, you may overwrite the music files in this folder.
