Because the music of the original game was bought under a royalty 
free license, they cannot be distributed here. However a proper replacement 
for these music files were added to the project with CCBY3 
license. This includes:

breakneck_loop (Corncob) - ccby3 by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100565

heartland (Jenny's Theme) - ccby3 by Jason Shaw http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Jason_Shaw/Audionautix_Acoustic/JENNYS_THEME___________________-45

truck_stop_loop (River Valley Breakdown) - ccby3 by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1300032

If you own the original purchased game, you may overwrite the music files in this 
folder with the original ones.
